# hello-world
Just a tutorial for GIT initiation

This Readme file is for the tutorial on GitHub (and effectively on the Gist protocol)

My name is Mark Sebastiaan van der Linden
I am a dentist and a Information Technology Nerd, I like hardware and software alike.

Some additional info: I use Linux as main operating system.
At my dental practise it's plain windows (to bad!)


cheers all!
